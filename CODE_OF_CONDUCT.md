# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a professional and respectful environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a positive experience for everyone, regardless of their background or level of experience.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using professional and respectful language
- Being open to differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project and the community
- Respecting the time and effort of community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Insulting, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [ryan@webgrip.nl](mailto:ryan@webgrip.nl). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
